<span class="i0"><span class="f1">B</span>etsy would never wash herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from her bed she rose,<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">But just as quickly as she could<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hurried on her clothes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep her clothes all nice and clean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Miss Betsy took no pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In holes her stockings always were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dresses filled with stains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes she went day after day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never combed her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While little feathers from her bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuck on it here and there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The schoolboys, when they Betsy saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would point her out, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh! Betsy, what a sight you are!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! Slovenly Betsy, fie!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One rainy day her parents went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some pleasant friends to meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took Betsy along with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All dressed so clean and neat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nice little boys and girls were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom our Betsy played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until of playing she grew tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the garden strayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the rain she danced awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'twas not long before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flat down she tumbled in the mud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her best clothes she tore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And she almost died with shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned, and to her home she ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, as here you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She washed her clothes, and since has been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As neat as she could be.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She thought the earth was so dirty and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never, by chance, would she look down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she held up her head in the air so high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her neck began stretching by and by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stretched and it stretched; and it grew so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her parents thought something must be wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stretched and stretched, and they soon began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look up with fear at their Phoebe Ann.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Until her neck had grown so long and spare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her head was more than her neck could bear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it bent to the ground, like a willow tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought down the head of this proud Phoebe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until whenever she went out a walk to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boys would shout, &#8220;Here comes a snake!&#8221;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or your neck may stretch, too, by and by.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clapp'd her hands, and danced, and sang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, on the table close at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A box of matches chanced to stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if she touched them they would scold her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Pauline said, &#8220;Oh, what a pity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when they burn it is so pretty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crackle so, and spit, and flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mamma often burns the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll only light a match or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I have often seen my mother do.&#8221;<br /></span>

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
